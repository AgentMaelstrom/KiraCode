# KiraCode README

Hi!

KiraCode is my first attempt at  a *working* custom programming language.

---

> ## **WIP**
>
> This project is ***entirely*** not finished yet. In fact, it has barely been started.

---

> ## **Please Note:**
>
> I am still a relatively inexperienced [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) programmer.
